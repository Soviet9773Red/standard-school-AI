## ðŸ“˜ Manifesto: Educating AI Like Humans

We propose a bold and simple idea:

> **AI should be educated like humans â€” using the proven structure of school education.** But instead of taking 10 years, it may take just a few days.

This document defines the core principles of the **Standard School Model (SSM)** â€” a universal framework for training and evaluating general-purpose AI systems.

## ðŸŽ“ Why This Matters

For decades, human society has refined school education to efficiently transmit knowledge, logic, ethics, and cultural understanding. Millions of people have been educated with the same basic subjects, following structured curriculums. We believe AI should follow a similar path.

Most modern LLMs are trained on massive, unfiltered corpora â€” random code, forums, fiction, social media, and everything in between. Instead, we propose training AI systems with a **minimal, structured, human-like knowledge base** inspired by real school education.

## ðŸ“š Core Structure of SSM

### 1. **Universal Knowledge Base**

Every AI model should have access to a compact, standardized set of school-level knowledge:
- Language and Grammar (native + English)
- Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry
- Biology, Physics, Chemistry
- Geography, History, Astronomy
- Logic, Ethics, Civic Education

This base knowledge can be encoded in roughly **60â€“100 textbooks** (equivalent to 10â€“20 MB of structured, curated text). It represents the total of what a human student learns in school.

### 2. **Built-in Reasoning Engine**

An AI should have a common architectural foundation:
- Logical thinking
- Step-by-step deduction
- Pattern recognition
- Hypothesis testing
- Error correction and adaptation

This reasoning engine is like a studentâ€™s mind â€” independent of the subject.

### 3. **Language Requirements**

Each AI model should be bilingual:
- **One native/local language** (e.g., Swedish, Russian, German)
- **One universal language** â€” English

This reflects real-world multilingual environments and improves both usability and inclusiveness.

### 4. **Pluggable Specialized Knowledge**

Special domains (e.g., medicine, law, programming, physics) are **added as modular "textbooks" or knowledge packs**, either during fine-tuning or runtime (e.g. RAG, vector DBs).

The base reasoning remains the same â€” like giving a smart student a new subject to master.

## âœ… Expected Capabilities

A model conforming to the SSM standard should be able to:
- Pass middle/high school exams
- Explain concepts in clear language
- Solve standard math, logic, science problems
- Write essays and summaries
- Hold ethical, contextual, and historical discussions
- Learn new specialized knowledge when provided

## ðŸ§  Benefits of SSM

- âœ… Transparent reasoning
- âœ… Easy to audit and test (school-style exams)
- âœ… Multilingual inclusivity
- âœ… Lower training costs
- âœ… Modular expansion
- âœ… Aligns AI with human learning logic

## ðŸ”„ Letâ€™s Stop Reinventing the Wheel

Humanity already invented a good system for developing intelligent minds. Letâ€™s adapt it for AI.

We donâ€™t need models trained on everything. We need models that understand **something** deeply, and can **grow logically**, like we do.

Letâ€™s stop dumping the entire internet into models and instead give them what worked for us: **a schoolbag full of well-written books and a mind ready to learn.**
